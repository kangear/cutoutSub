1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,801
- I would like to call the first meeting

2
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,304
of the Isaac Asimov book club to order.

3
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,406
I'm assuming everyone's read "Nightfall?"

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,410
- I read it.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,413
I may have dozed off a few times, but I read it.

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,914
- I read it as well.

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,017
I found it quite compelling.

8
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,819
A planet that only experiences nightfall

9
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:23,223
once every 2000 years.

10
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,324
- And once it does, it drives everyone mad.

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,226
Brilliant.

12
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,927
- I found the tension between the scientists

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,729
and the religious cultists reminiscent

14
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,831
of some dinnertime conversations at my house.

15
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,633
(laughing)

16
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,235
What did you think, Connie?

17
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:36,236
- What did you think, Connie?

18
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,137
- Eh.

19
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,238
You didn't like it?

20
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,639
- I don't need a story set on some outer space planet

21
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,943
to tell me that people freak out about change.

22
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:45,045
-Interesting.

23
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,147
People lost it when women started wearing pants

24
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,448
and getting jobs.

25
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,151
Everybody just overreacts to everything.

26
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,153
- Is this because Coach Ballard got upset

27
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,854
and broke up with you?

28
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:55,555
- No.
